# Master's Thesis - Quantum Solver for Routing Problems

This repository contains the code for the Master's Thesis project "Quantum Algorithms for Optimizing Urban Transportation" developed by Bruno Rosendo. The thesis can be found at [Reposit√≥rio Aberto](https://hdl.handle.net/10216/160532).

## How to Use

To use the solvers, you must choose your preferred model (CVRP or RPP) and solver (D-Wave, Qiskit or Classic) and set the parameters for the routing problem and platform. You can then solve and visualize or save the results.

An example of a simple CVRP problem with the D-Wave solver is shown below:

```python
from src.model.dispatcher import CVRP
from src.solver.qubo.DWaveSolver import DWaveSolver

# Define the problem parameters
model = CVRP(1, [(46, 32), (20, 32), (71, 32), (46, 60), (46, 4)], 5, [1] * 5)

# Define the solver
solver = DWaveSolver(model)

# Solve the problem
solution = solver.solve()

# Display the solution
solution.display()
```

### Choosing the Model

Currently, the project supports four routing problem variations: Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Capacitated VRP (CVRP), Multi-Capacitated VRP (MCVRP) and Ride Pooling Problem (RPP). You can find details about each problem in the [thesis document](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/160532).

The model be chosen by using one of two dispatcher functions: `CVRP` or `RPP`, depending on which problem you're trying to solve. The functions reside in `src/model/dispatcher.py`. The right variation will be used depending on the parameters you set.

These functions use a set of parameters that will define the routing problem at hand. These parameters are in the table:

| Parameter         | Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                      | Default            |

### Choosing the Solver

#### D-Wave Solver (Leap)

The `DWaveSolver` interacts with [D-Wave's Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/) cloud provider and is this project's most recommended quantum solver.

To set it up, you need to authenticate yourself in one of three ways:
- Copy your API token from the platform and create a `.env` file in the project's root with the line `DWAVE_API_TOKEN=<token>`.
- Create a `DWAVE_API_TOKEN` environment variable under your Python (virtual) environment with your API token.
- Install the [dwave-ocean-sdk](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/docs_cli.html) package and authenticate there.

This solver has the following parameters that can be configured:

| Parameter           | Type                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Default                                                                                                                                          |

#### Classical Solver (OR-Tools)

The `ClassicalSolver` uses the [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) library to solve the routing problem classically. This is a great way to test your inputs or compare the quantum solvers with a well-known classical solver.

This solver does not require any authentication, as it is a local solver. It has the following parameters that can be configured:

#### Cost functions

A cost function generates a distance matrix from the locations list. The default cost function is the Manhattan distance, but you can define your own cost function by creating a function that takes a list of coordinates and returns the matrix. For example:

```python
from src.model.VRP import DistanceUnit

def manhattan_distance(
    locations: list[tuple[int, int]], unit: DistanceUnit = DistanceUnit.METERS
) -> list[list[float]]:
    """
    Compute the Manhattan distance between all locations.
    """

    return [
        [
            abs(from_location[0] - to_location[0])
            + abs(from_location[1] - to_location[1])
            for to_location in locations
        ]
        for from_location in locations
    ]
  ``` 

The project currently supports the following distance units: `manhattan_distance`, `euclidean_distance`, `haversine_distance` and `distance_api`.

The last one, `distance_api`, is a particular cost function that uses Google's [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview) to calculate the distance between locations. This is useful for real-world problems where the distance matrix is unknown beforehand. To use it, you must set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key by adding it to the `.env` file or setting it in your (virtual) environment.

### Running the Solver

After defining the problem and choosing the solver, you can run the solver with the `solve()` method. This will return a `VRPSolution` object. You can then visualize the solution in the browser with the `display()` method, print it to the console using the `print()` method, or save it to a file with the `save_json()` method.

Loading a solution from a JSON file using the VRPSolution `from_json()` static method is also possible. This is useful for comparing solutions or visualizing them later.

## Development setup

If you want to contribute to this project, follow the instructions below to set up your development environment. Feel free to open issues or pull requests with questions or suggestions.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
- [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- All the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, installed via pip

### Running

The entry point for the application is usually the `src/main.py` file. You can also use other scripts under `src/scripts/` or create your own. To run them, execute Python with the desired script.

### Code Formatting

We use the [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) formatter for all Python code. There is no specific linter, as Black is an opinionated formatter that enforces a consistent style.
